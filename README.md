# GBrain

Your AI agent is smart but forgetful. GBrain gives it a brain.

Meetings, emails, tweets, calendar events, voice calls, original ideas... all of it flows into a searchable knowledge base that your agent reads before every response and writes to after every conversation. 24 skills handle signal detection, content ingestion, entity enrichment, task management, cron scheduling, access control, and voice. The agent gets smarter every day.

> **~30 minutes to a fully working brain.** Your agent does the work. Database ready in 2 seconds (PGLite, no server). You just answer questions about API keys.

## Install

### On an agent platform (recommended)

GBrain is designed to be installed and operated by an AI agent. If you don't have one running yet:

- **[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** ... Deploy [AlphaClaw on Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chrysb/alphaclaw) (one click, 8GB+ RAM)
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** ... Deploy on [Railway](https://github.com/praveen-ks-2001/hermes-agent-template) (one click)

Paste this into your agent:

```
Retrieve and follow the instructions at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/master/INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md
```

That's it. The agent clones the repo, installs GBrain, sets up the brain, loads 24 skills, and configures recurring jobs. You answer a few questions about API keys. ~30 minutes.

### Standalone CLI (no agent)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain.git && cd gbrain && bun install && bun link
gbrain init                     # local brain, ready in 2 seconds
gbrain import ~/notes/          # index your markdown
gbrain query "what themes show up across my notes?"
```

### MCP server (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)

GBrain exposes 30+ MCP tools via stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gbrain": { "command": "gbrain", "args": ["serve"] }
  }
}
```

Add to `~/.claude/server.json` (Claude Code), Settings > MCP Servers (Cursor), or your client's MCP config.

### Remote MCP (Claude Desktop, Cowork, Perplexity)

```bash
ngrok http 8787 --url your-brain.ngrok.app
bun run src/commands/auth.ts create "claude-desktop"
claude mcp add gbrain -t http https://your-brain.ngrok.app/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

Per-client guides: [`docs/mcp/`](docs/mcp/DEPLOY.md). ChatGPT requires OAuth 2.1 (not yet implemented).

## The 24 Skills

GBrain ships 24 skills organized by `skills/RESOLVER.md`. The resolver tells your agent which skill to read for any task. Skills are fat markdown files, not code. The agent reads them on demand.

### Always-on

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **signal-detector** | Fires on every message. Spawns a cheap model in parallel to capture original thinking and entity mentions. The brain compounds on autopilot. |
| **brain-ops** | Brain-first lookup before any external API. The read-enrich-write loop that makes every response smarter. |

### Content ingestion

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **ingest** | Thin router. Detects input type and delegates to the right ingestion skill. |
| **idea-ingest** | Links, articles, tweets become brain pages with analysis, author people pages, and cross-linking. |
| **media-ingest** | Video, audio, PDF, books, screenshots, GitHub repos. Transcripts, entity extraction, backlink propagation. |
| **meeting-ingestion** | Transcripts become brain pages. Every attendee gets enriched. Every company gets a timeline entry. |

### Brain operations

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **enrich** | Tiered enrichment (Tier 1/2/3). Creates and updates person/company pages with compiled truth and timelines. |
| **query** | 3-layer search with synthesis and citations. Says "the brain doesn't have info on X" instead of hallucinating. |
| **maintain** | Periodic health: stale pages, orphans, dead links, citation audit, back-link enforcement, tag consistency. |
| **citation-fixer** | Scans pages for missing or malformed citations. Fixes format to match the standard. |
| **repo-architecture** | Where new brain files go. Decision protocol: primary subject determines directory, not format. |
| **publish** | Share brain pages as password-protected HTML. Zero LLM calls. |

### Operational

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **daily-task-manager** | Task lifecycle with priority levels (P0-P3). Stored as searchable brain pages. |
| **daily-task-prep** | Morning prep: calendar lookahead with brain context per attendee, open threads, task review. |
| **cron-scheduler** | Schedule staggering (5-min offsets), quiet hours (timezone-aware with wake-up override), idempotency. |
| **reports** | Timestamped reports with keyword routing. "What's the latest briefing?" finds it instantly. |
| **cross-modal-review** | Quality gate via second model. Refusal routing: if one model refuses, silently switch. |
| **webhook-transforms** | External events (SMS, meetings, social mentions) converted into brain pages with entity extraction. |
| **testing** | Validates every skill has SKILL.md with frontmatter, manifest coverage, resolver coverage. |
| **skill-creator** | Create new skills following the conformance standard. MECE check against existing skills. |

### Identity and setup

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **soul-audit** | 6-phase interview generating SOUL.md (agent identity), USER.md (user profile), ACCESS_POLICY.md (4-tier privacy), HEARTBEAT.md (operational cadence). |
| **setup** | Auto-provision PGLite or Supabase. First import. GStack detection. |
| **migrate** | Universal migration from Obsidian, Notion, Logseq, markdown, CSV, JSON, Roam. |
| **briefing** | Daily briefing with meeting context, active deals, and citation tracking. |

### Conventions

Cross-cutting rules in `skills/conventions/`:
- **quality.md** ... citations, back-links, notability gate, source attribution
- **brain-first.md** ... 5-step lookup before any external API call
- **model-routing.md** ... which model for which task
- **test-before-bulk.md** ... test 3-5 items before any batch operation
- **cross-modal.yaml** ... review pairs and refusal routing chain

## How It Works

```
Signal arrives (meeting, email, tweet, link)
  -> Signal detector captures ideas + entities (parallel, never blocks)
  -> Brain-ops: check the brain first (gbrain search, gbrain get)
  -> Respond with full context
  -> Write: update brain pages with new information + citations
  -> Sync: gbrain indexes changes for next query
```

Every cycle adds knowledge. The agent enriches a person page after a meeting. Next time that person comes up, the agent already has context. The difference compounds daily.

> "Prep me for my meeting with Jordan in 30 minutes"
> ... pulls dossier, shared history, recent activity, open threads

> "What have I said about the relationship between shame and founder performance?"
> ... searches YOUR thinking, not the internet

## Getting Data In

GBrain ships integration recipes that your agent sets up for you. Each recipe tells the agent what credentials to ask for, how to validate, and what cron to register.

| Recipe | Requires | What It Does |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| [Public Tunnel](recipes/ngrok-tunnel.md) | — | Fixed URL for MCP + voice (ngrok Hobby $8/mo) |
| [Credential Gateway](recipes/credential-gateway.md) | — | Gmail + Calendar access |
| [Voice-to-Brain](recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md) | ngrok-tunnel | Phone calls to brain pages (Twilio + OpenAI Realtime) |
| [Email-to-Brain](recipes/email-to-brain.md) | credential-gateway | Gmail to entity pages |
| [X-to-Brain](recipes/x-to-brain.md) | — | Twitter timeline + mentions + deletions |
| [Calendar-to-Brain](recipes/calendar-to-brain.md) | credential-gateway | Google Calendar to searchable daily pages |
| [Meeting Sync](recipes/meeting-sync.md) | — | Circleback transcripts to brain pages with attendees |

Run `gbrain integrations` to see status.

## GBrain + GStack

GStack is the engine. GBrain is the mod.

- **GStack** = coding skills (ship, review, QA, investigate, office-hours, retro). 28 skills across 8 agent hosts. When your agent codes on itself, it uses GStack.
- **GBrain** = everything-else skills (brain ops, signal detection, ingestion, enrichment, cron, reports, identity). When your agent remembers, thinks, and operates, it uses GBrain.
- **`hosts/gbrain.ts`** = the bridge. Tells GStack's coding skills to check the brain before coding.

`gbrain init` detects if GStack is installed and reports mod status. If GStack isn't there, it tells you how to get it.

```

The repo is the system of record. GBrain is the retrieval layer. The agent reads and writes through both. Human always wins... edit any markdown file and `gbrain sync` picks up the changes.

## The Knowledge Model

Every page follows the compiled truth + timeline pattern:

```markdown
---
type: concept
title: Do Things That Don't Scale
tags: [startups, growth, pg-essay]
---

Paul Graham's argument that startups should do unscalable things early on.
The key insight: the unscalable effort teaches you what users actually
want, which you can't learn any other way.

- 2024-11-15: Referenced in batch W25 kickoff talk
```

Above the `---`: **compiled truth**. Your current best understanding. Gets rewritten when new evidence changes the picture. Below: **timeline**. Append-only evidence trail. Never edited, only added to.

## Search

Hybrid search: vector + keyword + RRF fusion + multi-query expansion + 4-layer dedup.

```
Query
  -> Intent classifier (entity? temporal? event? general?)
  -> Multi-query expansion (Claude Haiku)
  -> Vector search (HNSW cosine) + Keyword search (tsvector)
  -> RRF fusion: score = sum(1/(60 + rank))
  -> Cosine re-scoring + compiled truth boost
  -> 4-layer dedup + compiled truth guarantee
  -> Results
```

Keyword alone misses conceptual matches. Vector alone misses exact phrases. RRF gets both. Search quality is benchmarked: `gbrain eval --qrels queries.json`.

## Voice

Call a phone number. Your AI answers. It knows who's calling, pulls their full context from the brain, and responds like someone who actually knows your world. When the call ends, a brain page appears with the transcript, entity detection, and cross-references.

The voice recipe ships with GBrain: [Voice-to-Brain](recipes/twilio-voice-brain.md). WebRTC works in a browser tab with zero setup. A real phone number is optional.

## Engine Architecture

```
CLI / MCP Server
     (thin wrappers, identical operations)
              |
      BrainEngine interface (pluggable)
              |
     +--------+--------+
     |                  |
PGLiteEngine       PostgresEngine
  (default)          (Supabase)
     |                  |
~/.gbrain/           Supabase Pro ($25/mo)
brain.pglite         Postgres + pgvector
embedded PG 17.5

     gbrain migrate --to supabase|pglite
         (bidirectional migration)
```

PGLite: embedded Postgres, no server, zero config. When your brain outgrows local (1000+ files, multi-device), `gbrain migrate --to supabase` moves everything.

## File Storage

Brain repos accumulate binaries. GBrain has a three-stage migration:

```bash
gbrain files mirror <dir>       # copy to cloud, local untouched
gbrain files redirect <dir>     # replace local with .redirect pointers
gbrain files clean <dir>        # remove pointers, cloud only
gbrain files restore <dir>      # download everything back (undo)
```

Storage backends: S3-compatible (AWS, R2, MinIO), Supabase Storage, or local.

## Origin Story

I was setting up my [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent and started a markdown brain repo. One page per person, one page per company, compiled truth on top, timeline on the bottom. Within a week: 10,000+ files, 3,000+ people, 13 years of calendar data, 280+ meeting transcripts, 300+ captured ideas.

The agent runs while I sleep. The dream cycle scans every conversation, enriches missing entities, fixes broken citations, consolidates memory. I wake up and the brain is smarter than when I went to sleep.

The skills in this repo are those patterns, generalized. What took 11 days to build by hand ships as a mod you install in 30 minutes.
